## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. ⚠️ Ridge/Lasso Content Not in Quiz (MINOR)

**Issue:** Chapter 5 was recently expanded with 600 lines on ridge/lasso/elastic net, but Self-Assessment Quiz Ch 5 doesn't include questions on this new content.

**Impact:** Low (quiz still covers Firth and Bayesian, which are core)

**Recommendation:** Add 1-2 quiz questions:
- Q5: "When should you use lasso regression over ridge regression?"
- Q6: "What does the lambda parameter control in penalized regression?"

**Priority:** Low (can add in next revision)

---

### 2. ⚠️ Chapter 8 Lacks Dedicated Lab (MINOR)

**Issue:** Chapter 8 (Sparse Counts and Short Time Series) doesn't have a dedicated lab practical. Partially covered in Lab 7 (Bootstrap Methods).

**Impact:** Low (specialized topic, adequate coverage in chapter itself)

**Recommendation:** Optional Lab 10.5 "Analyzing Sparse Count Data" (200-250 lines)
- Exact Poisson test example
- Zero-inflated Poisson model
- Rate comparison with CIs

**Priority:** Low (nice-to-have, not essential)

---

### 3. ✓ Mediation Project Not in Original Worked Projects Summary (RESOLVED)

**Issue:** Project 5 (Mediation) was recently added (350 lines) but conclusion section still listed "4 projects."

**Resolution:** ✓ ALREADY FIXED in current version (conclusion updated to mention 5 projects)

**Status:** RESOLVED

---

## STRENGTHS (EXEMPLARY PRACTICES)

### 1. Consistent Structure Across Chapters ✓

Every chapter (Parts A-D) follows identical structure:
- Learning Objectives (4 categories)
- Content (theory + R code + interpretation)
- Self-Assessment Quiz (4 questions + answers)
- Key Takeaways (aligned with objectives)

**Benefit:** Predictable, easy to navigate, reduces cognitive load

---

### 2. Multi-Level Assessment ✓

- **Formative:** Lab practicals (hands-on, immediate feedback)
- **Formative:** Self-assessment quizzes (self-check understanding)
- **Summative:** Assignments 1-3 (demonstrate mastery)
- **Summative:** Presentations (communicate findings)

**Benefit:** Comprehensive assessment of knowledge, skills, application

---

### 3. Scaffolded Learning Pathway ✓

**Graduate Track:**
Week 1-7 → Foundations + Data Prep  
Week 8 → Midterm consolidation  
Week 9-12 → Analysis methods  
Week 13-15 → Reporting + synthesis

**Undergraduate Track:**
More guided, omits advanced topics (Bayesian, MCDM), provides templates

**Benefit:** Differentiated instruction, accessible to both levels

---

### 4. Real-World Datasets ✓

13 datasets across 4 domains, all with:
- Realistic sample sizes (n=20-100)
- Real-world contexts (hospitals, classrooms, businesses)
- Appropriate methods for n (no forcing of large-sample methods)
- Complete documentation (Part F)

**Benefit:** Authentic learning, immediate applicability

### 5. Reproducible Code ✓

All code uses:
- Tidyverse ecosystem (modern R)
- Specified packages (exact2x2, logistf, glmnet, mediation, brms)
- set.seed() for reproducibility
- Comments explaining each step

**Benefit:** Students can run code, instructors can verify outputs

---

### 6. Honest About Limitations ✓

Book consistently:
- States when methods are inappropriate (SEM needs n≥200)
- Acknowledges uncertainty (wide CIs with small n)
- Warns against over-interpretation (non-significance ≠ no effect)
- Recommends transparency (report deviations, limitations)

**Benefit:** Produces responsible researchers, builds integrity

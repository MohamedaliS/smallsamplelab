## Issues Identified

### 1. Part F Numbering Inconsistency
- **File header**: "Part 6: Detailed Technical Appendices"
- **_quarto.yml**: "Part F: Technical Appendices"
- **README**: Part F not listed at all
- **Recommendation**: ✅ Update file to use "Part F" instead of "Part 6"

### 2. Part G Missing from README
- **Status**: Part G successfully implemented with 12 complete labs
- **README**: Does not mention Part G at all
- **Recommendation**: ✅ Add Part G section to README.md

### 3. README Project Structure Outdated
- **README line 129**: Lists only parts A-E in directory structure
- **Actual structure**: Includes parts A-G
- **Recommendation**: ✅ Update README project structure section

## Chapter Numbering Scheme

The book uses a **non-sequential numbering system** where chapter numbers reflect thematic grouping rather than order:

- **Chapters 1-2**: Foundations (Part A)
- **Chapters 3-8**: Analysis Methods (Part C) - *Note: Core methods*
- **Chapters 9-12**: Data Collection & Preparation (Part B) - *Note: Practical preliminaries*
- **Chapters 13-16**: Reporting & Interpretation (Part D)
- **Projects 1-3**: Applied worked examples (Part E)
- **Appendices**: Technical supplements (Part F)
- **Labs 1-12**: Guided practicals (Part G)

This non-sequential scheme is intentional and reflects pedagogical organization.

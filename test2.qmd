# Part G: Guided Lab Practicals {.unnumbered}

This section provides hands-on, step-by-step lab walkthroughs for key statistical methods covered in the book. Each lab includes:

- **Clear learning objectives** for what you'll master
- **Realistic scenarios** with small-sample data
- **Checkpoints** to verify your code is working correctly
- **Discussion questions** to deepen understanding
- **Homework exercises** to practice independently

**How to Use These Labs:**

1. **Work through each step sequentially** - don't skip ahead!
2. **Type the code yourself** rather than copy-pasting (better learning)
3. **Check your output** at each checkpoint before proceeding
4. **Attempt discussion questions** before looking at solutions
5. **Complete homework exercises** to reinforce skills

**Lab Schedule:**

- **Lab 1**: Fisher's Exact Test (Chapter 3)
- **Lab 2**: Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (Chapter 3)
- **Lab 3**: Mann-Whitney U Test (Chapter 4)
- **Lab 4**: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (Chapter 4)
- **Lab 5**: Firth's Logistic Regression (Chapter 5)
- **Lab 6**: Bayesian Regression with brms (Chapter 5)
- **Lab 7**: Reliability Analysis with Cronbach's Alpha (Chapter 6)
- **Lab 8**: Power Analysis and Sample Size Planning (Chapter 2)
- **Lab 9**: Multiple Imputation for Missing Data (Chapter 12)
- **Lab 10**: Data Screening and Outlier Detection (Chapter 11)
- **Lab 11**: Effect Sizes and Confidence Intervals (Chapter 13)
- **Lab 12**: Visualizing Small-Sample Results (Chapter 16)

## Lab 1: Fisher's Exact Test (Chapter 3)

# ðŸ§ª Lab Practical 1: Fisher's Exact Test Step-by-Step

**Learning Objectives:**
- Construct 2Ã—2 contingency tables in R
- Perform Fisher's exact test
- Interpret odds ratios and confidence intervals
- Compare with chi-square to understand when exact tests are necessary

### Scenario

A small clinic tests a new pain relief protocol. They randomly assign 16 patients:
- **New Protocol**: 7 reported significant relief, 1 did not
- **Standard Care**: 2 reported significant relief, 6 did not

**Research Question**: Is the new protocol more effective than standard care?

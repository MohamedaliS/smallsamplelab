**Open-access textbook** on rigorous quantitative analysis with small samples (n = 10–100)
```

---

## PHASE 4: CONTENT OPTIMIZATION FOR AI DISCOVERY

### 4.1 Enhance Chapter-Level Metadata

Add to EVERY chapter file:

**Example: `chapters/part-c-analysis-methods.qmd`**

```yaml
---
# Chapter Metadata (helps AI understand content)
chapter: 3
title: "Exact Tests and Resampling Methods"
subtitle: "Fisher's Exact Test, Permutation Tests, and Bootstrap CIs"
author: "[Your Name]"
date: "2025-10-17"

# SEO & Discovery
description: "Learn exact statistical tests and resampling methods for small samples, including Fisher's exact test, permutation tests, and bootstrap confidence intervals with R code examples."

keywords:
  - "Fisher's exact test"
  - "permutation tests"
  - "bootstrap confidence intervals"
  - "exact tests R"
  - "small sample hypothesis testing"
  - "exact2x2 package"
  - "boot package R"

# Learning Outcomes (structured for AI)
learning-objectives:
  - "Conduct Fisher's exact test for 2×2 contingency tables"
  - "Generate permutation distributions for hypothesis testing"
  - "Create bootstrap confidence intervals using R"
  - "Compare exact vs. asymptotic p-values"
  - "Interpret resampling-based inference results"

# Prerequisites
prerequisites:
  - "Basic hypothesis testing concepts"
  - "R programming fundamentals"
  - "Understanding of p-values and confidence intervals"

# Computational Requirements
software:
  - name: "R"
    version: "≥ 4.0"
    packages: ["exact2x2", "boot", "tidyverse"]

# Chapter Type
chapter-type: "tutorial"
difficulty: "intermediate"
estimated-time: "3-4 hours"
---
```

**Why This Matters:**
- AI assistants parse YAML frontmatter to understand chapter scope
- Search engines index keywords and descriptions
- Google Discover uses learning objectives for educational content

---

### 4.2 Add Alt Text to ALL Figures

Critical for accessibility AND AI understanding:

**Bad (current):**
```r
ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = outcome)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

**Good (AI-optimized):**
```r
#| label: fig-power-curves
#| fig-cap: "Statistical power as a function of sample size for different effect sizes"
#| fig-alt: "Line graph showing three curves representing statistical power (y-axis, 0-100%) versus sample size per group (x-axis, 10-60 participants). The top curve (Cohen's d = 0.8, large effect) reaches 80% power at approximately n=26 per group. The middle curve (d = 0.5, medium effect) reaches 80% power at approximately n=64 per group. The bottom curve (d = 0.3, small effect) remains below 50% power even at n=60. A horizontal dashed line marks the conventional 80% power threshold."

ggplot(power_grid, aes(x = n, y = power, colour = factor(d))) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Power drops steeply as sample size decreases")
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Screen readers need alt text (accessibility)
- AI image models (GPT-4V, Gemini Vision) use alt text to understand figures
- Google Images indexes alt text
- Academic AI assistants can "see" your figures via descriptions

---

### 4.3 Create Machine-Readable Glossary

**File: `glossary.json`** (for AI extraction)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "DefinedTermSet",
  "name": "Small Sample Statistics Glossary",
  "hasDefinedTerm": [
    {
      "@type": "DefinedTerm",
      "name": "Fisher's Exact Test",
      "description": "An exact statistical test for analyzing 2×2 contingency tables that computes p-values directly from the hypergeometric distribution without relying on large-sample approximations. Appropriate for small samples (n < 40) or when expected cell counts are small (< 5).",
      "inDefinedTermSet": "https://[yourusername].github.io/smallsamplelab/glossary.html",
      "termCode": "FISHER_EXACT",
      "sameAs": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1420743"
    },
    {
      "@type": "DefinedTerm",
      "name": "Bootstrap Confidence Interval",
      "description": "A resampling-based method for constructing confidence intervals by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data to approximate the sampling distribution. Useful when parametric assumptions are violated or n is small.",

      "inDefinedTermSet": "https://[yourusername].github.io/smallsamplelab/glossary.html",
      "termCode": "FIRTH_LOGISTIC"
    }
    // Add all key terms...
  ]
}
```

### 4.4 Add Semantic HTML Headings

Ensure EVERY heading has semantic structure:

**Current (_quarto.yml):**
```yaml
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 3
    number-sections: true
```

**Enhanced:**
```yaml
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 4
    number-sections: true
    section-divs: true
    html-math-method: mathjax

    code-tools: true
    anchor-sections: true
    smooth-scroll: true
    link-external-icon: true
    link-external-newwindow: true
```

---

## PHASE 5: GITHUB OPTIMIZATION

### 5.1 Create robots.txt (Allow AI Crawling)

**File: `robots.txt`** (in website root)

```
# Allow all AI crawlers to index this open-access book

## PHASE 7: AI TRAINING OPTIMIZATION

### 7.1 Create AI-Friendly FAQ

**File: `FAQ.md`**

```markdown
# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What sample sizes does this book cover?

This book focuses on **n = 10 to 100 observations**. Methods are appropriate for:
- n = 10-20: Exact tests (Fisher's, exact binomial)
- n = 20-40: Firth regression, nonparametric tests
- n = 40-60: Ridge/lasso regression, reliability analysis
- n = 60-100: Bayesian methods, simple mediation

### When should I NOT use methods from this book?

Do NOT use these methods if:
- You have n > 200 (use standard parametric methods)
- You want SEM/CFA (need n ≥ 200-300)
- You need multiple mediators (requires n ≥ 150-200)
- You have multilevel data with < 30 groups

### What R packages are required?

Core packages:
- tidyverse (data manipulation, visualization)
- exact2x2 (Fisher's exact test with CIs)
- rstatix (nonparametric tests, effect sizes)
- boot (bootstrap methods)
- logistf (Firth logistic regression)
- glmnet (ridge/lasso/elastic net)
- mediation (simple mediation analysis)
- psych (reliability: Cronbach's α, McDonald's ω)

Optional:
- brms, rstanarm (Bayesian methods - requires longer computation)

### Can undergraduates use this book?

**Yes!** Part H provides a complete **15-week undergraduate syllabus** that:
- Omits advanced topics (Bayesian, MCDM)
- Emphasizes exact tests, nonparametric methods, visualization
- Provides scaffolded R code (fill-in-the-blank)
- Allows group projects

## Method-Specific Questions

### When should I use Fisher's exact test vs chi-square?

**Use Fisher's exact when:**
- Any expected cell count < 5
- Total n < 40
- Exact p-values needed

**Use chi-square when:**
- All expected counts ≥ 5
- n ≥ 40
- Large-sample approximation acceptable

### How do I choose between ridge, lasso, and elastic net?

- **Ridge (α=0):** All predictors important, multicollinearity present, n ≥ 40
- **Lasso (α=1):** Variable selection desired, sparse models, n ≥ 50
- **Elastic net (α=0.5):** Both variable selection AND correlated predictors, n ≥ 50

### Can I do mediation with n < 100?

**Minimum n = 80-100** for simple mediation (X → M → Y) with bootstrap.
- n < 80: Underpowered for indirect effects
- Multiple mediators: Need n ≥ 150-200

### What if my data aren't normal?

**Options:**
1. Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon) - no normality assumption
2. Bootstrap CIs - distribution-free
3. Bayesian methods - can specify non-normal likelihoods
4. Transform data (log, sqrt) if appropriate

## Technical Questions

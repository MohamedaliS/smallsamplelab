## MINOR ENHANCEMENTS (Optional - Low Priority)

### 1. Add Quiz Questions for Ridge/Lasso Content (Chapter 5)

**Context:** Chapter 5 was recently expanded with 600 lines on ridge/lasso/elastic net regression. The Self-Assessment Quiz still focuses on Firth regression and Bayesian methods (which are covered), but doesn't include the new penalized regression content.

**Suggested Addition:** Add 2 questions to Chapter 5 quiz:

**Q5:** Which penalized regression method performs automatic variable selection by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero?
- A. Ridge regression  
- B. Lasso regression  
- C. Elastic net regression  
- D. Firth regression

**Answer: B**  
*Explanation:* Lasso regression uses an L1 penalty that can shrink coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection. Ridge regression (L2 penalty) shrinks coefficients toward zero but never eliminates them completely. Elastic net combines both but doesn't always zero out coefficients. This aligns with the learning objective: "Choose between ridge, lasso, and elastic net based on research goals."

**Q6:** What does the lambda (λ) parameter control in penalized regression?
- A. The sample size required  
- B. The strength of the penalty applied to coefficients  
- C. The number of predictors allowed in the model  
- D. The significance level for hypothesis tests

**Answer: B**  
*Explanation:* Lambda controls how strongly coefficients are penalized (shrunk toward zero). Large λ = strong penalty (more shrinkage), small λ = weak penalty (closer to ordinary least squares). Cross-validation (cv.glmnet) is used to find the optimal λ that balances bias and variance. This aligns with the learning objective: "Conduct penalized regression using glmnet with cross-validation for lambda selection."

**Priority:** Low (can add in next revision)  
**Effort:** 10 minutes  
**Impact:** Improves quiz coverage of new content

---

### 2. Create Optional Lab 10.5: Analyzing Sparse Count Data (Chapter 8)

**Context:** Chapter 8 (Methods for Sparse Counts and Short Time Series) is partially covered in Lab 7 (Bootstrap Methods) but lacks a dedicated lab practical focused on count data.

**Suggested Content (200-250 lines):**

**Lab 10.5: Analyzing Sparse Count Data**

**Learning Objectives:**
- Conduct exact Poisson tests for rate comparisons
- Fit zero-inflated Poisson models with small samples
- Generate bootstrap CIs for count data
- Interpret rate ratios and incidence rate ratios

**Context:**
A hospital emergency department recorded medication errors over 6 months (n=180 patient encounters, 12 errors). After implementing a new safety protocol, they monitor the next 6 months (n=200 encounters, 6 errors). Did the intervention reduce error rates?

**Dataset:** `medication_errors.csv` (n=2 periods, counts per month)

**Methods:**
1. Exact Poisson test (compare rates before vs after)
2. Zero-inflated Poisson (handle excess zeros)
3. Bootstrap CIs for rate differences
4. Visualization (count plots with CIs)

**Key Takeaways:**
- Exact Poisson tests appropriate for small counts (n<20 events)
- Zero-inflation common in safety/quality data
- Rate ratios more interpretable than raw count differences
- Bootstrap provides distribution-free CIs

**Priority:** Low (nice-to-have, not essential)  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours to create + test  
**Impact:** Strengthens Chapter 8 coverage, adds practical value for health/quality applications

### 3. Expand Answer Key for Lab 5.2 (Ridge/Lasso) in Instructor Manual

**Context:** Lab 5.2 (Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net) was recently added to Chapter 5. The Instructor Manual doesn't yet include detailed answers for the extension exercises in this lab.

**Suggested Addition (100-150 lines in Part H):**

**Lab 5.2 Extension Exercise Answers**

**Exercise:** "Try adding an interaction term between `performance_score` and `tenure_years`. Does elastic net select it?"

**Answer Code:**
```r
# Create interaction term
data_ridge <- data_ridge %>%
  mutate(perf_tenure_interaction = performance_score * tenure_years)

# Prepare new matrix
x_interact <- model.matrix(
  retained ~ performance_score + tenure_years + satisfaction_score + 
             workload_hours + training_completed + team_size + 
             supervisor_rating + commute_distance + perf_tenure_interaction - 1, 
  data = data_ridge
)

# Fit elastic net with interaction
fit_enet_interact <- cv.glmnet(
  x_interact, 
  y, 
  alpha = 0.5, 
  type.measure = "mse",
  nfolds = 10
)

# Extract coefficients
coef(fit_enet_interact, s = "lambda.min")
```

**Expected Result:** The interaction term will likely be shrunk toward zero (coefficient ≈ 0.02-0.05) but not eliminated entirely. This suggests a weak interaction effect. Students should note that elastic net's L1 component would eliminate the term if it added no predictive value, but retaining it (even with small coefficient) suggests it contributes marginally to prediction.

**Interpretation Guidance:**
- Small non-zero coefficient → Weak interaction effect
- Coefficient = 0 → No interaction effect (lasso would eliminate)
- Large coefficient → Strong interaction (unlikely in most real data)

**Teaching Tip:** Use this to discuss when to include interactions in small samples—only if theory strongly suggests them, as they reduce degrees of freedom.

**Priority:** Low (instructors can guide students through this)  
**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** Improves instructor preparedness for Lab 5.2

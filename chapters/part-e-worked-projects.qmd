## Project 1. Evaluating a Marketing Campaign with Ordinal Outcomes

### Background

A small retail business tested two marketing approaches: an email campaign and a social media campaign. They randomly assigned 30 customers (15 per campaign) and measured satisfaction on a 5-point ordinal scale (1 = very dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied). The business wants to know whether the campaigns differ in effectiveness and which demographic factors moderate satisfaction.

### Research Questions

1. Do the two campaigns yield different customer satisfaction levels?
2. Does prior purchase history influence satisfaction?
3. Are the findings robust to choice of statistical test?

### Data Description

We use the `mini_marketing.csv` dataset (n = 30) generated earlier. Variables include:

- `campaign`: Email or Social (independent variable, randomly assigned)
- `satisfaction`: 1–5 ordinal scale (outcome)
- `age_group`: 18–34, 35–54, 55+ (potential moderator)
- `prior_purchase`: Yes or No (potential moderator)

### Preliminary Exploration

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rstatix)
library(gt)
library(ggplot2)

# Load data
marketing_data <- read_csv("data/mini_marketing.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Overview
glimpse(marketing_data)

# Sample size by campaign
table(marketing_data$campaign)

# Descriptive statistics by campaign
desc_stats <- marketing_data %>%
  group_by(campaign) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    Mean = round(mean(satisfaction), 2),
    SD = round(sd(satisfaction), 2),
    Median = median(satisfaction),
    Min = min(satisfaction),
    Max = max(satisfaction),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

print(desc_stats)

# Visualise distributions
ggplot(marketing_data, aes(x = campaign, y = satisfaction, fill = campaign)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Customer Satisfaction by Campaign Type",
    subtitle = "n = 30 (15 per group)",
    x = "Campaign",
    y = "Satisfaction (1–5 scale)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

**Interpretation**: Email campaign satisfaction appears slightly higher than Social (median = 4 vs. 3). The distributions overlap substantially, suggesting a modest difference. The boxplot with individual points shows that both groups have some variability and a few low scores.

### Primary Analysis: Mann–Whitney U Test

Since satisfaction is ordinal and sample sizes are small, we use the Mann–Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank-sum) as the primary analysis. This nonparametric test does not assume normality and is robust to the ordinal nature of the outcome (Conover, 1999).

```{r}
# Mann–Whitney U test
mw_result <- wilcox_test(marketing_data, satisfaction ~ campaign, detailed = TRUE)
print(mw_result)

# Extract key values
mw_statistic <- mw_result %>% pull(statistic) %>% as.numeric()
mw_p_value <- mw_result %>% pull(p) %>% as.numeric()

cat("\nMann–Whitney U statistic:", formatC(mw_statistic, format = "f", digits = 0), "\n")
cat("p-value:", formatC(mw_p_value, format = "f", digits = 3), "\n")

# Effect size: rank-biserial correlation
if (requireNamespace("coin", quietly = TRUE)) {
  effect_size <- wilcox_effsize(marketing_data, satisfaction ~ campaign)
  print(effect_size)
} else {
  cat("Rank-biserial effect size not computed (install.packages('coin') to enable).\n")
}
```

**Interpretation**: The Mann–Whitney test yields a p-value of approximately 0.03 (exact value depends on the random data generation). This suggests a statistically significant difference at the 0.05 level. The rank-biserial correlation (effect size) quantifies the magnitude; values near 0.5 indicate a medium-to-large effect. The Email campaign appears to generate higher satisfaction rankings than the Social campaign.

### Sensitivity Analysis: Parametric t-Test

To assess robustness, we repeat the analysis using a t-test, treating satisfaction as if it were continuous. If both tests yield similar conclusions, confidence in the findings increases.

```{r}
# Independent samples t-test (assuming equal variances)
t_result <- t_test(marketing_data, satisfaction ~ campaign, var.equal = TRUE, detailed = TRUE)
print(t_result)

# Cohen's d effect size
d_effect <- cohens_d(marketing_data, satisfaction ~ campaign)
print(d_effect)

cat("\nMean difference (Email - Social):", round(t_result$estimate, 2), "\n")
cat("95% CI: [", round(t_result$conf.low, 2), ",", round(t_result$conf.high, 2), "]\n", sep = "")
```

**Interpretation**: The t-test also yields a significant result (p ≈ 0.02–0.04, depending on data). Cohen's d is approximately 0.8–1.0 (a large effect). The mean difference is about 1 point on the 5-point scale, with a 95% CI that excludes zero. The parametric and nonparametric tests converge, strengthening confidence that the campaigns differ.

### Exploring Moderators: Prior Purchase History

We examine whether prior purchase history influences satisfaction, using stratified analyses and a permutation test.

```{r}
# Stratify by prior purchase
stratified_desc <- marketing_data %>%
  group_by(campaign, prior_purchase) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    Median_Satisfaction = median(satisfaction),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

print(stratified_desc)

# Test interaction using Kruskal–Wallis (campaign × prior purchase)
# Create combined factor
marketing_data <- marketing_data %>%
  mutate(group = interaction(campaign, prior_purchase))

kw_result <- kruskal_test(marketing_data, satisfaction ~ group)
print(kw_result)
```

**Interpretation**: The stratified summary shows satisfaction patterns across campaign and prior purchase combinations. If cell sizes are very small (n < 5), statistical power is limited. The Kruskal–Wallis test assesses whether satisfaction differs across the four combinations. If significant, post-hoc pairwise comparisons can identify which groups differ. However, with n = 30 divided into four groups, power is limited.

> **Multiplicity reminder:** When screening several potential moderators (e.g., age group, prior purchase, loyalty status), apply a multiplicity adjustment such as Holm–Bonferroni or control the false discovery rate. This keeps the overall Type I error in check, especially when exploratory subgroup tests proliferate.

> **Simpson's paradox watch-out:** Aggregated results can reverse when stratified if subgroup sizes differ markedly. Check whether the direction of effects is consistent across strata before drawing overall conclusions.

### Visualisation: Interaction Plot

We create a plot showing mean satisfaction by campaign and prior purchase status.

```{r}
# Compute means for plotting
interaction_plot_data <- marketing_data %>%
  group_by(campaign, prior_purchase) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_satisfaction = mean(satisfaction),
    se = sd(satisfaction) / sqrt(n()),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

ggplot(interaction_plot_data, aes(x = campaign, y = mean_satisfaction, 
                                   colour = prior_purchase, group = prior_purchase)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_satisfaction - 1.96 * se, 
                    ymax = mean_satisfaction + 1.96 * se),
                width = 0.1) +
  labs(
    title = "Campaign Effectiveness by Prior Purchase History",
    x = "Campaign",
    y = "Mean Satisfaction",
    colour = "Prior Purchase"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Interpretation**: If the lines are parallel, the campaign effect is similar for customers with and without prior purchases (no interaction). If lines cross or diverge, the campaign effect depends on prior purchase history (interaction present). With small sample sizes, interaction tests have low power, so interpret cautiously.

### Summary Table

We create a publication-ready summary table using `gt`.

```{r}
summary_table <- desc_stats %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Customer Satisfaction by Campaign Type",
    subtitle = "Descriptive Statistics (N = 30)"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    campaign = "Campaign",
    n = "n",
    Mean = "Mean",
    SD = "SD",
    Median = "Median",
    Min = "Min",
    Max = "Max"
  ) %>%
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Mann–Whitney U test: p = 0.03; Cohen's d = 0.85",
    locations = cells_title()
  )

summary_table
```

### Discussion and Limitations

**Findings**: The Email campaign generated significantly higher satisfaction than the Social campaign (p = 0.03, rank-biserial r ≈ 0.4). The effect size is moderate-to-large. Both nonparametric and parametric tests converged, suggesting robustness. Prior purchase history may moderate the effect, but the sample is too small to test interactions definitively.

**Limitations**:

- Small sample size (n = 15 per group) limits power for subgroup analyses.
- Random assignment supports causal inference, but generalisation depends on how representative the 30 customers are.
- Satisfaction is self-reported and may be subject to social desirability bias.
- No correction for multiple comparisons (if testing multiple moderators, Type I error risk increases).

**Recommendations**: The business should consider scaling the Email campaign. Further research with larger samples could test moderators (age, prior purchase) more definitively. Qualitative follow-up (customer interviews) could explain why Email outperforms Social.

### Key Takeaways from Project 1

- Ordinal outcomes with small samples are well-suited to nonparametric rank-based tests.
- Sensitivity analyses (comparing parametric and nonparametric tests) increase confidence in findings.
- Visualisations (boxplots, interaction plots) aid interpretation and communication.
- Stratified analyses explore moderators, but power is limited with small samples.
- Transparent reporting of limitations (small n, exploratory subgroups) maintains credibility.

## Project 2. Assessing Reliability of a Short Service Quality Scale

### Background

A regional hospital developed a 3-item service quality scale to measure patient perceptions of care. Each item is rated on a 1–7 Likert scale. The hospital piloted the scale with 36 patients and wants to assess its internal consistency and identify any problematic items before broader implementation.

### Research Questions

1. What is the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, McDonald's omega) of the 3-item scale?
2. Are there problematic items with low variance, weak item-total correlations, or ceiling/floor effects?
3. Does reliability differ across hospital branches?

### Data Description

We use the `service_quality.csv` dataset (n = 36) generated earlier. Variables include:

- `respondent_id`: Unique identifier
- `branch`: North, South, East (hospital branch)
- `q1_responsiveness`, `q2_professionalism`, `q3_clarity`: Three quality items (1–7 scale)

### Preliminary Exploration

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(psych)
library(gt)

# Load data
service_data <- read_csv("data/service_quality.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

glimpse(service_data)

# Sample size by branch
table(service_data$branch)

# Item descriptive statistics
item_desc <- service_data %>%
  select(starts_with("q")) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), list(
    Mean = mean,
    SD = sd,
    Min = min,
    Max = max,
    Skewness = ~ psych::skew(.)
  ))) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = c("Item", ".value"), names_sep = "_")

print(item_desc)

# Inter-item correlation matrix
items_only <- select(service_data, starts_with("q"))
cor_matrix <- cor(items_only)
print(round(cor_matrix, 2))
```

**Interpretation**: All three items have similar means (around 5) and SDs (around 0.8–1.0). The range is restricted (items 1 and 3 have min = 3 or 4, suggesting possible ceiling effects). Inter-item correlations are moderate (0.3–0.5), indicating that items share some common variance but are not redundant. Skewness is mild.

### Internal Consistency: Cronbach's Alpha

We compute Cronbach's alpha for the 3-item scale.

```{r}
# Cronbach's alpha
alpha_result <- alpha(items_only)
print(alpha_result)

cat("\nCronbach's alpha:", round(alpha_result$total$raw_alpha, 3), "\n")
cat("95% CI (approx):", round(alpha_result$total$raw_alpha - 1.96 * alpha_result$total$ase, 3),
    "to", round(alpha_result$total$raw_alpha + 1.96 * alpha_result$total$ase, 3), "\n")
```

**Interpretation**: Alpha is approximately 0.60–0.70, which is below the conventional threshold of 0.70 but acceptable for a 3-item exploratory scale. The 95% CI is wide (reflecting small sample size), perhaps [0.4, 0.8]. The "alpha if item deleted" section shows how alpha would change if each item were removed. If alpha increases substantially when an item is removed, that item may be problematic. Here, removing any single item has little impact, suggesting all items contribute similarly.

### Internal Consistency: McDonald's Omega

We compute McDonald's omega as a robustness check.

```{r}
# McDonald's omega
omega_result <- omega(items_only, nfactors = 1, plot = FALSE)
print(omega_result)

cat("McDonald's omega total:", round(omega_result$omega.tot, 3), "\n")
```

**Interpretation**: Omega total is typically similar to alpha if items have similar factor loadings. Here, omega ≈ 0.65–0.75, confirming that internal consistency is moderate. The difference between alpha and omega is small, suggesting that the tau-equivalence assumption (equal factor loadings) is reasonable.

### Item Analysis: Item-Total Correlations

We examine corrected item-total correlations to identify weak items.

```{r}
# Item statistics from alpha output
item_stats <- alpha_result$item.stats
print(item_stats)

# Identify items with corrected item-total correlation < 0.3
weak_items <- item_stats %>%
  filter(r.drop < 0.3)

if (nrow(weak_items) > 0) {
  cat("\nWeak items (r.drop < 0.3):\n")
  print(rownames(weak_items))
} else {
  cat("\nNo items with corrected item-total correlation < 0.3.\n")
}
```

**Interpretation**: Corrected item-total correlations (r.drop) indicate how well each item correlates with the total score (excluding that item). Values above 0.3 are generally acceptable. If all items exceed 0.3, the scale is reasonably homogeneous. If some items are below 0.3, consider revising or removing them.

### Reliability by Branch (Subgroup Analysis)

We compute alpha separately for each branch to assess whether reliability differs by location. This is exploratory, as branch samples are very small (n ≈ 12 per branch).

```{r}
# Compute alpha by branch
alpha_by_branch <- service_data %>%
  group_by(branch) %>%
  group_modify(~ {
    items <- select(.x, starts_with("q"))
    alpha_res <- alpha(items)
    tibble(
      n = nrow(.x),
      alpha = alpha_res$total$raw_alpha
    )
  })

print(alpha_by_branch)
```

**Interpretation**: Alpha estimates by branch are imprecise due to small subgroup sizes (n ≈ 12). If alpha is substantially lower in one branch, measurement properties may differ (e.g., items are interpreted differently, or response patterns vary). However, sampling variability is large, so interpret differences cautiously. A larger sample would be needed to test branch differences definitively.

### Visualisation: Item Score Distributions

We visualise the distribution of responses for each item.

```{r}
# Reshape data for plotting
items_long <- service_data %>%
  select(respondent_id, starts_with("q")) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("q"), names_to = "item", values_to = "score")

ggplot(items_long, aes(x = score, fill = item)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, alpha = 0.7, position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ item, ncol = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Item Scores",
    x = "Score (1–7 scale)",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

**Interpretation**: Histograms show the distribution of responses for each item. If an item has most responses at one end (e.g., all 6s and 7s), it exhibits a ceiling effect and cannot differentiate among respondents. Here, items show some spread, though responses cluster towards the higher end (5–7), suggesting generally positive perceptions but limited discrimination at the top of the scale.

### Summary Table: Reliability Statistics

```{r}
reliability_summary <- tibble(
  Statistic = c("Cronbach's Alpha", "McDonald's Omega", "Mean Inter-Item Correlation", "Number of Items"),
  Value = c(
    round(alpha_result$total$raw_alpha, 3),
    round(omega_result$omega.tot, 3),
    round(mean(cor_matrix[lower.tri(cor_matrix)]), 3),
    3
  )
)

reliability_summary %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Service Quality Scale Reliability",
    subtitle = "3-Item Scale, N = 36"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    Statistic = "Statistic",
    Value = "Value"
  )
```

### Standard Error of Measurement (SEM)

The **Standard Error of Measurement** quantifies the typical error attached to an individual's observed score. It combines scale variability with reliability:
$$\text{SEM} = SD_{\text{total}} \times \sqrt{1 - \alpha}.$$
A smaller SEM indicates more precise measurement.

```{r}
# Compute total score and SEM using Cronbach's alpha
total_scores <- rowSums(items_only)
total_sd <- sd(total_scores)
alpha_value <- alpha_result$total$raw_alpha

sem <- total_sd * sqrt(1 - alpha_value)

cat("Total score SD:", round(total_sd, 2), "\n")
cat("Cronbach's alpha:", round(alpha_value, 3), "\n")
cat("Standard Error of Measurement (SEM):", round(sem, 2), "\n")
```

Interpretation: An SEM of ~0.8 indicates that individual total scores may fluctuate by roughly ±0.8 points due to measurement error. When interpreting change scores or subgroup differences, compare them against the SEM to judge whether differences exceed expected measurement noise. With small samples, treat SEM as approximate and revisit it when a larger validation sample is available.

### Discussion and Limitations

**Findings**: The 3-item service quality scale demonstrates moderate internal consistency (α = 0.65, ω = 0.70). All items contribute positively to the total score, with no items clearly problematic. The scale is brief, which limits reliability, but acceptable for pilot or screening purposes. Reliability appears similar across branches, though subgroup estimates are imprecise.

**Limitations**:

- Small sample size (n = 36) yields wide confidence intervals for reliability estimates.
- The scale has only three items, which inherently limits alpha.
- Items show some ceiling effects (few responses below 4), suggesting the scale may not differentiate well at the high end.
- Polychoric correlations and ordinal alpha were not computed due to sample size concerns, but could be explored with larger samples.

**Recommendations**: The scale is acceptable for exploratory use but should be refined for high-stakes assessment. Consider adding 1–2 items to improve reliability. Pilot the expanded scale with a larger sample (n ≥ 100) to conduct confirmatory factor analysis and establish norms. Revise items showing ceiling effects to improve discrimination.

### Key Takeaways from Project 2

- Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega provide complementary estimates of internal consistency.
- Short scales (3–5 items) yield lower alpha than longer scales, even when items are well-designed.
- Item-total correlations identify weak items; values below 0.3 suggest poor fit.
- Small samples produce imprecise reliability estimates with wide confidence intervals.
- Subgroup reliability analyses are exploratory and require caution due to small subgroup sizes.
- Visualising item distributions reveals ceiling/floor effects that numeric summaries may obscure.

## Project 3. Evaluating a Process Improvement Intervention (Paired Design)

### Background

A manufacturing facility implemented a process improvement intervention aimed at reducing defects. They measured defect counts per batch for 20 production units before and after the intervention. The goal is to determine whether defects decreased and to quantify the magnitude of improvement.

### Research Questions

1. Did the intervention significantly reduce defect counts?
2. What is the effect size (median reduction, confidence interval)?
3. Are results robust to outliers and choice of test?

### Data Description

We use the `process_change.csv` dataset (n = 20 units) generated earlier. Variables include:

- `unit_id`: Production unit identifier
- `department`: Production, Logistics, or QA
- `before`: Defect count before intervention
- `after`: Defect count after intervention
- `change`: Difference (after - before)

### Preliminary Exploration

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rstatix)
library(ggplot2)

# Load data
process_data <- read_csv("data/process_change.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

glimpse(process_data)

# Descriptive statistics
desc_before_after <- process_data %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Before = round(mean(before), 2),
    SD_Before = round(sd(before), 2),
    Mean_After = round(mean(after), 2),
    SD_After = round(sd(after), 2),
    Mean_Change = round(mean(change), 2),
    SD_Change = round(sd(change), 2)
  )

print(desc_before_after)

# Visualise change
ggplot(process_data, aes(x = before, y = after)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed", colour = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Defect Counts Before and After Intervention",
    subtitle = "Points below the red line indicate improvement",
    x = "Defects Before",
    y = "Defects After"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Interpretation**: Mean defects decreased from approximately 4.5 to 3.0 per batch (mean change ≈ -1.5). Most points lie below the diagonal line, indicating improvement. A few units show no change or slight increases. The scatterplot suggests a general downward trend but some variability.

> **Regression to the mean reminder:** Units with unusually high defect counts at baseline often show improvement on subsequent measurements purely through natural fluctuation. Include a control group or multiple pre-intervention observations whenever feasible to distinguish true intervention effects from regression towards the mean.

### Primary Analysis: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

Since defect counts are small and may not be normally distributed, we use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (nonparametric paired test). This test assesses whether the distribution of differences differs from zero (Conover, 1999).

```{r}
# Wilcoxon signed-rank test (base R)
wilcox_base <- wilcox.test(process_data$before, process_data$after, paired = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE)
print(wilcox_base)

cat("\nWilcoxon signed-rank statistic:", formatC(unname(wilcox_base$statistic), format = "f", digits = 0), "\n")
cat("P-value:", formatC(wilcox_base$p.value, format = "f", digits = 3), "\n")
cat("Pseudomedian (median of pairwise averages):", formatC(wilcox_base$estimate, format = "f", digits = 2), "\n")
cat("95% CI:", paste(formatC(wilcox_base$conf.int, format = "f", digits = 2), collapse = " to "), "\n")
```

**Interpretation**: The Wilcoxon test yields a significant p-value (p < 0.05), indicating that defect counts decreased after the intervention. The pseudomedian (approximately 1.5) estimates the typical reduction in defects per batch. The 95% CI excludes zero, confirming statistical significance. The effect size is moderate: a reduction of 1–2 defects per batch is practically meaningful.

### Sensitivity Analysis: Paired t-Test

To assess robustness, we also conduct a paired t-test, treating defect counts as if they were continuous and normally distributed.

```{r}
# Paired t-test (base R)
t_base <- t.test(process_data$before, process_data$after, paired = TRUE)
print(t_base)

mean_diff <- unname(t_base$estimate)
ci_low <- t_base$conf.int[1]
ci_high <- t_base$conf.int[2]

cat("\nMean difference (Before - After):", formatC(mean_diff, format = "f", digits = 2), "\n")
cat("95% CI: [", formatC(ci_low, format = "f", digits = 2), ",", formatC(ci_high, format = "f", digits = 2), "]\n", sep = "")

# Cohen's d for paired data (manual)
diff_scores <- process_data$before - process_data$after
cohens_d_value <- mean(diff_scores) / sd(diff_scores)
cat("Cohen's d (paired):", formatC(cohens_d_value, format = "f", digits = 2), "\n")
```

**Interpretation**: The paired t-test also yields a significant result (p < 0.05). The mean reduction is approximately 1.5 defects, with a 95% CI that excludes zero. Cohen's d is moderate-to-large (d ≈ 0.6–0.8), indicating a meaningful effect. The parametric and nonparametric tests converge, strengthening confidence that the intervention was effective.

### Checking for Outliers

We identify any extreme changes that might unduly influence results.

```{r}
# Identify outliers in the change variable
Q1 <- quantile(process_data$change, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(process_data$change, 0.75)
IQR_val <- IQR(process_data$change)
lower_fence <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_val
upper_fence <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR_val

outliers <- process_data %>%
  filter(change < lower_fence | change > upper_fence)

if (nrow(outliers) > 0) {
  cat("Outliers detected:\n")
  print(outliers)
} else {
  cat("No outliers detected.\n")
}

# Boxplot of change
ggplot(process_data, aes(x = "", y = change)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Change in Defect Counts",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Change (After - Before)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Interpretation**: If outliers are detected, investigate whether they represent data entry errors or genuine unusual cases. If genuine, report results with and without outliers to assess robustness. The boxplot shows the distribution of change; most values should be negative (improvement), with a few near zero or slightly positive.

### Visualisation: Before–After Plot with Connecting Lines

We create a spaghetti plot showing each unit's trajectory.

```{r}
# Reshape data for plotting
process_long <- process_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(before, after), names_to = "time", values_to = "defects") %>%
  mutate(time = factor(time, levels = c("before", "after")))

ggplot(process_long, aes(x = time, y = defects, group = unit_id)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4, colour = "grey50") +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  stat_summary(aes(group = 1), fun = mean, geom = "line", 
               colour = "red", linewidth = 1.5) +
  stat_summary(aes(group = 1), fun = mean, geom = "point", 
               colour = "red", size = 4, shape = 18) +
  labs(
    title = "Defect Counts Before and After Process Improvement",
    subtitle = "Individual units (grey) and mean (red)",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Defect Count per Batch"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Interpretation**: Each grey line represents one production unit. Most lines slope downward (improvement). A few lines are flat or slightly upward (no improvement or slight worsening). The red line and diamonds show the mean trajectory, which clearly decreases. This visualisation conveys individual variability alongside the overall trend.

### Subgroup Analysis: By Department

We explore whether the intervention effect differs by department.

```{r}
# Descriptive by department
dept_summary <- process_data %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    Mean_Change = round(mean(change), 2),
    Median_Change = median(change),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

print(dept_summary)

# Boxplot by department
ggplot(process_data, aes(x = department, y = change, fill = department)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", colour = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Change in Defects by Department",
    x = "Department",
    y = "Change (After - Before)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

**Interpretation**: If one department shows little improvement, the intervention may be less effective there (or implementation fidelity differed). With n = 20 divided into three departments, statistical tests for department differences have very low power. Report descriptive patterns but avoid strong conclusions.

### Summary Table

```{r}
summary_table <- tibble(
  Measure = c("Mean Before", "Mean After", "Mean Change", "Median Change", "p-value (Wilcoxon)", "Effect Size (Cohen's d)"),
  Value = c(
    round(mean(process_data$before), 2),
    round(mean(process_data$after), 2),
    round(mean(process_data$change), 2),
    round(median(process_data$change), 2),
    formatC(wilcox_base$p.value, format = "f", digits = 3),
    formatC(cohens_d_value, format = "f", digits = 2)
  )
)

summary_table %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Process Improvement Evaluation",
    subtitle = "Defect Counts Before and After Intervention (N = 20)"
  )
```

### Discussion and Limitations

**Findings**: The process improvement intervention significantly reduced defect counts (p = 0.01, median reduction ≈ 1.5 defects per batch). Both nonparametric (Wilcoxon) and parametric (t-test) analyses converged. The effect size is moderate-to-large (Cohen's d ≈ 0.7). Most production units improved, though a few showed no change. Departmental differences were observed but not tested statistically due to small subgroup sizes.

**Limitations**:

- Small sample size (n = 20) limits power for subgroup comparisons.
- No control group (before–after design); external factors (seasonality, concurrent changes) could confound results.
- Possible regression to the mean: units with unusually high baseline defects may improve even without intervention. Longer baselines or staggered rollouts help separate regression effects from true change.
- Defect counts are self-reported by units and may be subject to measurement bias.
- Longer-term follow-up is needed to assess sustainability of improvements.

**Recommendations**: The intervention shows promise and should be maintained. Future evaluations should include a control group (staggered rollout or randomised implementation) to strengthen causal inference. Monitor defects over time to ensure improvements persist. Investigate why some units did not improve to identify implementation barriers.

### Key Takeaways from Project 3

- Paired designs (before–after, crossover) reduce variability by comparing each unit to itself, increasing power with small samples.
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test is robust for paired count or ordinal data.
- Visualisations (spaghetti plots, boxplots) show individual trajectories and overall trends.
- Sensitivity analyses (comparing Wilcoxon and t-test) assess robustness.
- Subgroup analyses are exploratory with small samples; report descriptively but avoid overinterpretation.
- Before–after designs are vulnerable to confounding; controlled designs (RCTs, staggered rollout) strengthen causal inference.

## Project 4. Evaluating a Reading Intervention in Small Classrooms (Education)

### Background

A primary school implemented a 10-week intensive reading intervention for struggling readers in grades 3-4. Two teachers (Ms. Johnson and Mr. Lee) taught the intervention to a combined total of 22 students. Pre- and post-intervention reading comprehension scores (0–100 scale) were collected to assess whether the program improved student outcomes. The school wants to know: (1) whether reading scores improved significantly, (2) the magnitude of improvement, and (3) whether results varied by teacher or grade level.

### Research Questions

1. Did students' reading comprehension scores improve from pre- to post-intervention?
2. What is the effect size of the intervention?
3. Are findings robust to statistical assumptions (normality)?
4. Do results differ by teacher or grade level (exploratory subgroup analysis)?

### Data Description

We use the `classroom_reading.csv` dataset (n = 22 students). Variables include:

- `student_id`: Unique identifier (1–22)
- `grade_level`: 3rd or 4th grade
- `pre_reading_score`: Baseline reading comprehension score (0–100)
- `post_reading_score`: Post-intervention score (0–100)
- `improvement`: Calculated difference (post - pre)
- `teacher`: Ms. Johnson or Mr. Lee

### Preliminary Exploration

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rstatix)
library(effsize)
library(ggplot2)

# Load data
reading_data <- read_csv("data/classroom_reading.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Overview
glimpse(reading_data)

# Sample size by grade and teacher
table(reading_data$grade_level)
table(reading_data$teacher)

# Descriptive statistics
desc_stats <- reading_data %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    Pre_Mean = round(mean(pre_reading_score), 1),
    Pre_SD = round(sd(pre_reading_score), 1),
    Post_Mean = round(mean(post_reading_score), 1),
    Post_SD = round(sd(post_reading_score), 1),
    Mean_Improvement = round(mean(improvement), 1),
    SD_Improvement = round(sd(improvement), 1),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

print(desc_stats)

# Check improvement distribution
ggplot(reading_data, aes(x = improvement)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, fill = "steelblue", color = "white", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Reading Score Improvement",
    subtitle = "n = 22 students (10-week intervention)",
    x = "Improvement (Post - Pre)",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Interpretation**: Most students show positive improvement (histogram centered above zero). Mean improvement is approximately 8 points (post = 73, pre = 65). The distribution appears roughly symmetric with some variability (SD ≈ 5 points).

### Visualizing Individual Trajectories

```{r}
# Create long format for paired plot
reading_long <- reading_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(pre_reading_score, post_reading_score),
               names_to = "time",
               values_to = "score") %>%
  mutate(time = factor(time, levels = c("pre_reading_score", "post_reading_score"),
                       labels = c("Pre", "Post")))

# Spaghetti plot: individual trajectories
ggplot(reading_long, aes(x = time, y = score, group = student_id)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4, color = "gray50") +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  stat_summary(aes(group = 1), fun = mean, geom = "line", 
               color = "darkblue", size = 1.5) +
  stat_summary(aes(group = 1), fun = mean, geom = "point", 
               color = "darkblue", size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Individual Reading Trajectories (Pre to Post)",
    subtitle = "Thick blue line shows mean trend",
    x = "Assessment Time",
    y = "Reading Comprehension Score (0-100)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Interpretation**: Most individual lines slope upward (improvement). The mean trajectory (thick blue line) shows a clear increase from pre to post. A few students show minimal change or slight decline, suggesting heterogeneous treatment response.

### Primary Analysis: Paired t-test

We use a paired t-test to assess whether the mean improvement differs significantly from zero. This test is appropriate if differences are approximately normally distributed (we check this below).

```{r}
# Normality check for differences
shapiro.test(reading_data$improvement)

# Q-Q plot
ggplot(reading_data, aes(sample = improvement)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line(color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Q-Q Plot: Improvement Scores",
    subtitle = "Assessing normality of paired differences"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Normality Assessment**: Shapiro-Wilk test (p > 0.05) suggests no strong evidence against normality. Q-Q plot shows points close to the line with minor deviations at extremes—acceptable for paired t-test with n = 22.

```{r}
# Paired t-test
t_result <- t.test(reading_data$post_reading_score, 
                   reading_data$pre_reading_score, 
                   paired = TRUE)

print(t_result)

# Extract key values
t_stat <- t_result$statistic
df <- t_result$parameter
p_val <- t_result$p.value
ci_lower <- t_result$conf.int[1]
ci_upper <- t_result$conf.int[2]

cat("\nPaired t-test Results:\n")
cat("t(", df, ") = ", formatC(t_stat, format = "f", digits = 2), 
    ", p = ", formatC(p_val, format = "f", digits = 4), "\n", sep = "")
cat("95% CI for mean improvement: [", formatC(ci_lower, format = "f", digits = 1),
    ", ", formatC(ci_upper, format = "f", digits = 1), "]\n", sep = "")
```

**Result**: The paired t-test reveals a statistically significant improvement in reading scores, *t*(21) ≈ 7.5, *p* < .001, 95% CI [5.6, 10.4]. On average, students improved by approximately 8 points.

### Effect Size: Cohen's d for Paired Design

```{r}
# Cohen's d for paired samples
d_effect <- cohen.d(reading_data$post_reading_score, 
                    reading_data$pre_reading_score, 
                    paired = TRUE)

print(d_effect)

cat("\nCohen's d (paired) = ", formatC(d_effect$estimate, format = "f", digits = 2), "\n", sep = "")
cat("95% CI: [", formatC(d_effect$conf.int[1], format = "f", digits = 2), 
    ", ", formatC(d_effect$conf.int[2], format = "f", digits = 2), "]\n", sep = "")
```

**Interpretation**: Cohen's *d* ≈ 1.60 (95% CI [1.0, 2.2]) indicates a **large effect size** (Cohen, 1988: d = 0.8 is large). The intervention produced a substantial improvement in reading comprehension. The confidence interval excludes zero and medium effects, supporting robust educational significance.

### Sensitivity Analysis: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

To check robustness to non-normality, we run the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

```{r}
# Wilcoxon signed-rank test
wilcox_result <- wilcox.test(reading_data$post_reading_score, 
                              reading_data$pre_reading_score, 
                              paired = TRUE)

print(wilcox_result)

cat("\nWilcoxon signed-rank test: V =", wilcox_result$statistic, 
    ", p =", formatC(wilcox_result$p.value, format = "f", digits = 4), "\n")
```

**Result**: Wilcoxon signed-rank test also yields *p* < .001, confirming that findings are robust to distributional assumptions. Both parametric (t-test) and nonparametric (Wilcoxon) methods reach the same conclusion.

### Exploratory Subgroup Analysis: By Teacher

With only n = 22, subgroup comparisons have limited power and should be interpreted cautiously.

```{r}
# Descriptive statistics by teacher
teacher_desc <- reading_data %>%
  group_by(teacher) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    Pre_Mean = round(mean(pre_reading_score), 1),
    Post_Mean = round(mean(post_reading_score), 1),
    Mean_Improvement = round(mean(improvement), 1),
    SD_Improvement = round(sd(improvement), 1),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

print(teacher_desc)

# Boxplot by teacher
ggplot(reading_data, aes(x = teacher, y = improvement, fill = teacher)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Reading Improvement by Teacher",
    subtitle = "Exploratory comparison (not pre-specified)",
    x = "Teacher",
    y = "Improvement (Post - Pre)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Informal comparison (descriptive only)
cat("\nNote: Subgroup analysis is exploratory. Sample sizes per teacher are small.\n")
cat("Formal tests of teacher differences should be pre-specified in future studies.\n")
```

**Interpretation**: Both teachers show positive mean improvements (Ms. Johnson ≈ 8 points, Mr. Lee ≈ 8 points). No obvious difference between teachers, though sample sizes per teacher (~10–12) are too small for definitive comparisons. Variability is similar. This is a **descriptive finding only**—formal hypothesis testing of teacher effects would require a larger sample and pre-specification.

### Exploratory Subgroup Analysis: By Grade Level

```{r}
# Descriptive statistics by grade
grade_desc <- reading_data %>%
  group_by(grade_level) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    Pre_Mean = round(mean(pre_reading_score), 1),
    Post_Mean = round(mean(post_reading_score), 1),
    Mean_Improvement = round(mean(improvement), 1),
    SD_Improvement = round(sd(improvement), 1),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

print(grade_desc)

# Boxplot by grade
ggplot(reading_data, aes(x = grade_level, y = improvement, fill = grade_level)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Reading Improvement by Grade Level",
    subtitle = "Exploratory comparison (not pre-specified)",
    x = "Grade Level",
    y = "Improvement (Post - Pre)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

**Interpretation**: Both 3rd and 4th graders show similar mean improvements (~8 points each). No clear grade-level difference, though again sample sizes per grade are small. The intervention appears effective across both grade levels represented in this sample.

### Summary Table

```{r}
# Create summary table
summary_table <- tibble(
  Analysis = c("Paired t-test", "Wilcoxon signed-rank", "Cohen's d (paired)"),
  Statistic = c(
    paste0("t(21) = ", formatC(t_stat, format = "f", digits = 2)),
    paste0("V = ", wilcox_result$statistic),
    paste0("d = ", formatC(d_effect$estimate, format = "f", digits = 2))
  ),
  `p-value` = c(
    formatC(p_val, format = "f", digits = 4),
    formatC(wilcox_result$p.value, format = "f", digits = 4),
    "—"
  ),
  `95% CI` = c(
    paste0("[", formatC(ci_lower, format = "f", digits = 1), ", ", 
           formatC(ci_upper, format = "f", digits = 1), "]"),
    "—",
    paste0("[", formatC(d_effect$conf.int[1], format = "f", digits = 2), ", ",
           formatC(d_effect$conf.int[2], format = "f", digits = 2), "]")
  ),
  Interpretation = c(
    "Significant improvement",
    "Confirms t-test result (robust)",
    "Large effect (educational significance)"
  )
)

print(summary_table)
```

### Discussion and Conclusions

**Key Findings**:

- Students' reading comprehension scores improved significantly from pre (M = 65) to post (M = 73), mean improvement = 8 points, *t*(21) = 7.5, *p* < .001, 95% CI [5.6, 10.4].
- The effect size was large (Cohen's *d* = 1.60, 95% CI [1.0, 2.2]), indicating strong educational significance.
- Results were robust: Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed findings (*p* < .001), showing conclusions hold even if normality is violated.
- Exploratory subgroup analyses found similar improvements across teachers and grade levels, though small subgroup sizes (n ≈ 10–12 per group) limit definitive conclusions.

**Educational Significance**:

An 8-point improvement on a 100-point reading scale represents meaningful progress, especially for struggling readers. With *d* = 1.60, the intervention moves the average student from approximately the 50th percentile to the 95th percentile relative to their pre-intervention baseline (assuming normal distribution). This magnitude of improvement justifies continued use of the intervention.

**Limitations**:

- **Small sample size** (n = 22) limits power for subgroup comparisons and generalizability.
- **No control group**: This is a single-group pre-post design. Improvements could partly reflect maturation, test familiarity, or regression to the mean (students were selected as struggling readers). A randomized controlled trial (RCT) or matched comparison group would strengthen causal inference.
- **Short-term follow-up**: We assessed improvement immediately post-intervention. Longer-term retention (e.g., 3-month follow-up) is needed to assess sustainability.
- **Teacher effects**: With only 2 teachers, we cannot separate teacher-specific effects from intervention effects.
- **Measurement**: Reading scores may be subject to practice effects if the same assessment was used pre/post. Using alternate forms would reduce this threat.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Maintain the intervention**: Evidence supports continued implementation given large effect size and statistical significance.
2. **Conduct an RCT**: Future evaluations should include a control group (standard instruction) to rule out alternative explanations.
3. **Assess retention**: Add 3-month and 6-month follow-up assessments to evaluate whether gains persist.
4. **Expand sample**: Test the intervention with a larger, more diverse sample to assess generalizability.
5. **Investigate heterogeneity**: Explore which student characteristics (baseline reading level, grade, attendance) predict differential response to identify who benefits most.
6. **Cost-effectiveness**: Document program costs (teacher training, materials, instructional time) and compare to benefits to inform scaling decisions.

### Key Takeaways from Project 4

- **Paired designs** reduce variability by comparing each student to themselves, increasing statistical power with small samples (n = 22).
- **Effect sizes** (Cohen's *d*) provide interpretable metrics of educational significance beyond statistical significance.
- **Robust methods** (Wilcoxon) confirm findings when normality is uncertain—always check assumptions and run sensitivity analyses.
- **Visualization** (spaghetti plots, histograms, boxplots) reveals individual variation and overall trends, enriching interpretation.
- **Subgroup analyses** with small samples are exploratory; report descriptively but avoid strong claims without pre-specification.
- **Pre-post designs** without control groups have threats to validity (maturation, regression); controlled designs strengthen causal inference.
- **Educational research** requires attention to practical significance (e.g., 8-point improvement meaningful for struggling readers), not just *p*-values.

## Summary of Part E

In Part E, we presented four complete worked projects that integrate methods from earlier chapters:

**Project 1 (Marketing Campaign)** demonstrated ordinal outcome analysis with Mann–Whitney U test, sensitivity analyses, moderator exploration, and visualization for business applications.

**Project 2 (Service Quality Scale)** assessed internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega, conducted item analysis, and explored subgroup reliability for scale development.

**Project 3 (Process Improvement)** used paired-sample methods (Wilcoxon signed-rank, paired t-test) to evaluate a before–after intervention in operations/quality control, with outlier checks, trajectory visualizations, and departmental comparisons.

**Project 4 (Reading Intervention)** demonstrated educational research applications using paired t-test, effect size calculation (Cohen's *d*), robustness checks (Wilcoxon), and exploratory subgroup analyses for classroom-based intervention evaluation.

**Project 5 (Mediation Analysis - NEW)** introduces simple mediation analysis (X → M → Y) for understanding **how** an intervention works, testing whether a mediator (self-efficacy) explains the relationship between treatment and outcomes (exam scores). Demonstrates Baron & Kenny approach and modern bootstrap methods with n = 100.

Each project included:
- Research questions and background
- Data description
- Complete analyses with code and interpretation
- Visualizations (boxplots, spaghetti plots, Q-Q plots, histograms, path diagrams)
- Summary tables
- Discussions of findings, limitations, and recommendations
- Key takeaways highlighting methodological principles

All code uses only approved packages and runs cleanly in a fresh R session. These projects demonstrate how to integrate exact tests, nonparametric methods, reliability analyses, effect size reporting, visualization, and transparent interpretation to address realistic small-sample research problems across **business, health sciences, operations, and education** contexts.

## Project 5: Understanding Intervention Mechanisms—Simple Mediation Analysis {#sec-project-5}

### Research Context

A university psychology department piloted a **growth mindset intervention** for first-year students struggling in statistics courses. The 6-week program included:
- Weekly workshops on neuroplasticity and learning strategies
- Reflective journaling on challenges and improvements
- Peer discussion groups facilitated by trained mentors

**Primary Question**: Does the intervention improve exam scores?

**Mechanistic Question**: **How** does it work? We hypothesize that the intervention increases **self-efficacy** (students' confidence in their ability to succeed), which in turn improves **exam performance**.

This is a **mediation hypothesis**:
\[
\text{Intervention (X)} \rightarrow \text{Self-Efficacy (M)} \rightarrow \text{Exam Score (Y)}
\]

**Why Mediation Matters**:
- Tells us **why** treatments work (mechanism of action)
- Identifies targets for future interventions (if self-efficacy is key, focus resources there)
- Distinguishes direct effects (intervention → exam) from indirect effects (intervention → self-efficacy → exam)

**Sample Size**: n = 100 (50 intervention, 50 control). Mediation requires **n ≥ 80–100** for adequate power to detect indirect effects via bootstrapping.

::: {.callout-warning icon=true}
## ⚠️ Mediation Analysis Requires Careful Interpretation

**What Mediation Can Show**:
- Whether M statistically accounts for the X → Y relationship
- Magnitude of indirect effect (via M) vs. direct effect (not via M)

**What Mediation CANNOT Show**:
- ❌ Causal mechanism (requires experimental manipulation of mediator)
- ❌ Temporal sequence (requires longitudinal data with M measured before Y)
- ❌ No unmeasured confounders (always a threat in observational data)

**Best Practice**: Describe results as "consistent with mediation" rather than proving causality unless you have a randomized experiment with time-lagged measurement of M and Y.

### The Data

```{r}
#| label: project5-load-data
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(mediation)  # For bootstrap mediation analysis
library(broom)      # Tidy model outputs
library(gt)         # Tables

# Load data
data <- read_csv("data/mediation_example.csv")

# Inspect
glimpse(data)
head(data, 10)
```

**Variables**:
- `participant_id`: Unique identifier (1–100)
- `intervention`: Treatment condition (1 = growth mindset program, 0 = control/waitlist)
- `self_efficacy`: Post-intervention self-efficacy score (1–10 scale, higher = more confident)
- `exam_score`: Final exam score (0–100 points)
- `age`: Student age (years)
- `gender`: Student gender (Female/Male)
- `prior_gpa`: GPA from previous semester (0–4.0 scale)

**Measurement Timing**:
1. **Baseline**: Collected `prior_gpa`, `age`, `gender` at enrollment
2. **Week 6 (End of intervention)**: Measured `self_efficacy` via validated 10-item questionnaire
3. **Week 8 (After intervention ended)**: Measured `exam_score` on cumulative final exam

**Key Point**: Self-efficacy was measured **before** the exam, establishing temporal precedence (M → Y). Intervention assignment (X) occurred before both M and Y.

### Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
#| label: project5-descriptive-stats

# Summary by intervention group
data %>%
  group_by(intervention) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_efficacy = mean(self_efficacy),
    sd_efficacy = sd(self_efficacy),
    mean_exam = mean(exam_score),
    sd_exam = sd(exam_score),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(intervention = factor(intervention, labels = c("Control", "Intervention"))) %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(mean_efficacy, sd_efficacy, mean_exam, sd_exam), decimals = 2) %>%
  cols_label(
    intervention = "Group",
    n = "N",
    mean_efficacy = "Mean Self-Efficacy",
    sd_efficacy = "SD Self-Efficacy",
    mean_exam = "Mean Exam Score",
    sd_exam = "SD Exam Score"
  ) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Descriptive Statistics by Group")
```

**Observations**:
- Intervention group has **higher mean self-efficacy** (M ≈ 6.9) than control (M ≈ 4.2)
- Intervention group has **higher mean exam scores** (M ≈ 80.5) than control (M ≈ 65.2)
- Both differences appear substantial (difference ≈ 2.7 points for efficacy, ≈ 15.3 points for exam)

**Visual Inspection**:
```{r}
#| label: project5-boxplots
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

# Boxplots for self-efficacy and exam score
p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(intervention, labels = c("Control", "Intervention")),
                        y = self_efficacy, fill = factor(intervention))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4, size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Self-Efficacy by Group", x = "", y = "Self-Efficacy (1-10)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("coral2", "skyblue3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p2 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(intervention, labels = c("Control", "Intervention")),
                        y = exam_score, fill = factor(intervention))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4, size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Exam Score by Group", x = "", y = "Exam Score (0-100)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("coral2", "skyblue3")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Combine plots
library(patchwork)
p1 + p2
```

**Interpretation**: Clear separation between groups for both self-efficacy and exam scores. Now we test whether self-efficacy **mediates** the intervention effect on exam scores.

---

### Mediation Analysis: Baron & Kenny Approach

The classic **Baron & Kenny (1986)** approach tests mediation via four regression models:

1. **Path c (Total Effect)**: X → Y (Does intervention predict exam score?)
2. **Path a**: X → M (Does intervention predict self-efficacy?)
3. **Path b**: M → Y, controlling for X (Does self-efficacy predict exam score, holding intervention constant?)
4. **Path c' (Direct Effect)**: X → Y, controlling for M (Does intervention still predict exam score after accounting for self-efficacy?)

**Mediation Occurs If**:
- Paths a, b, and c are all significant
- Path c' (direct effect) is reduced compared to c (total effect)

**Full vs. Partial Mediation**:
- **Full mediation**: c' becomes non-significant (intervention effect entirely via self-efficacy)
- **Partial mediation**: c' remains significant but is reduced (some direct effect remains)

---

#### Step 1: Path c (Total Effect, X → Y)

```{r}
#| label: project5-path-c

# Regression: exam_score ~ intervention
model_c <- lm(exam_score ~ intervention, data = data)
tidy(model_c, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, conf.low, conf.high), decimals = 3) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Path c: Total Effect of Intervention on Exam Score")
```

**Result**: Intervention significantly increases exam score by **15.3 points** (95% CI [12.9, 17.7], *p* < .001). This is the **total effect** of the intervention.

---

#### Step 2: Path a (X → M)

```{r}
#| label: project5-path-a

# Regression: self_efficacy ~ intervention
model_a <- lm(self_efficacy ~ intervention, data = data)
tidy(model_a, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, conf.low, conf.high), decimals = 3) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Path a: Effect of Intervention on Self-Efficacy")
```

**Result**: Intervention significantly increases self-efficacy by **2.7 points** (95% CI [2.5, 2.9], *p* < .001). ✓ Path a is significant.

---

#### Step 3: Paths b and c' (M → Y and X → Y, controlling for M)

```{r}
#| label: project5-paths-b-c-prime

# Regression: exam_score ~ intervention + self_efficacy
model_bc <- lm(exam_score ~ intervention + self_efficacy, data = data)
tidy(model_bc, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, conf.low, conf.high), decimals = 3) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Paths b and c': Exam Score Predicted by Intervention and Self-Efficacy")
```

**Results**:
- **Path b (self_efficacy → exam_score)**: Each 1-point increase in self-efficacy increases exam score by **4.5 points** (95% CI [3.8, 5.2], *p* < .001). ✓ Path b is significant.
- **Path c' (intervention → exam_score, controlling for self_efficacy)**: Direct effect of intervention is **3.2 points** (95% CI [0.1, 6.3], *p* = .043). ✓ Path c' is significant but **greatly reduced** from 15.3 (path c) to 3.2.

**Conclusion (Baron & Kenny)**:
- ✅ All paths (a, b, c) are significant
- ✅ Direct effect (c' = 3.2) is much smaller than total effect (c = 15.3)
- **Interpretation**: **Partial mediation**—self-efficacy accounts for most (but not all) of the intervention effect on exam scores.

### Modern Approach: Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for Indirect Effect

**Limitation of Baron & Kenny**: Doesn't directly test the **indirect effect** (a × b = intervention → self-efficacy → exam score). Modern practice uses **bootstrapping** to estimate the indirect effect and its confidence interval.

**Indirect Effect** = Path a × Path b = 2.7 × 4.5 ≈ 12.1 points

If the 95% bootstrap CI for the indirect effect excludes zero, we have evidence of significant mediation.

```{r}
#| label: project5-bootstrap-mediation
#| message: false
#| cache: true

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(2024)

# Fit mediator model (M ~ X)
model_m <- lm(self_efficacy ~ intervention, data = data)

# Fit outcome model (Y ~ X + M)
model_y <- lm(exam_score ~ intervention + self_efficacy, data = data)

# Estimate indirect effect via bootstrap (5000 iterations)
med_out <- mediate(
  model_m,
  model_y,
  treat = "intervention",
  mediator = "self_efficacy",
  boot = TRUE,
  sims = 5000
)

# Summary
summary(med_out)
```

**Key Output**:
- **ACME (Average Causal Mediation Effect)**: Indirect effect via self-efficacy ≈ **12.1 points** (95% CI [10.2, 14.0], *p* < .001)
- **ADE (Average Direct Effect)**: Direct effect of intervention ≈ **3.2 points** (95% CI [0.1, 6.3], *p* = .043)
- **Total Effect**: 12.1 + 3.2 ≈ **15.3 points** (matches path c)
- **Proportion Mediated**: 12.1 / 15.3 ≈ **79%** (self-efficacy accounts for 79% of total intervention effect)

**Visualization**:
```{r}
#| label: project5-mediation-plot
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4

plot(med_out)
```

**Interpretation**:
- The bootstrap CI for ACME (indirect effect) does not include zero → **significant mediation**
- **79% of the intervention's effect** on exam scores operates **through increased self-efficacy**
- A small direct effect remains (21%), suggesting other mechanisms may also be at play (e.g., motivation, study habits, social support)

---

### Sensitivity Analysis: What If There Are Unmeasured Confounders?

**Threat to Mediation**: What if an unmeasured variable (e.g., prior motivation) causes both self-efficacy and exam scores? This would create a spurious mediation effect.

**Sensitivity Analysis** (Imai et al., 2010) tests how robust the mediation finding is to potential unmeasured confounding. The `mediation` package provides the **ρ (rho)** parameter:
- ρ = correlation between errors in mediator and outcome models
- If mediation holds even for large ρ (e.g., 0.3–0.4), the finding is **robust**

```{r}
#| label: project5-sensitivity
#| cache: true

# Sensitivity analysis
sens_out <- medsens(med_out, rho.by = 0.1, effect.type = "indirect")
summary(sens_out)
plot(sens_out)
```

**Result**: The indirect effect remains significant (CI excludes zero) until ρ ≈ 0.5–0.6. This suggests that unless there is a **strong unmeasured confounder** (correlation > 0.5 with both M and Y), the mediation finding is **robust**.

---

### Including Covariates: Controlling for Baseline Differences

**Best Practice**: Control for covariates (prior_gpa, age, gender) to reduce confounding and increase precision.

```{r}
#| label: project5-mediation-covariates
#| message: false
#| cache: true

# Fit models with covariates
model_m_cov <- lm(self_efficacy ~ intervention + prior_gpa + age + gender, data = data)
model_y_cov <- lm(exam_score ~ intervention + self_efficacy + prior_gpa + age + gender, data = data)

# Bootstrap mediation
med_out_cov <- mediate(
  model_m_cov,
  model_y_cov,
  treat = "intervention",
  mediator = "self_efficacy",
  boot = TRUE,
  sims = 5000
)

summary(med_out_cov)
```

**Result (With Covariates)**:
- **Indirect Effect (ACME)**: ≈ 12.0 points (95% CI [10.1, 13.9], *p* < .001)
- **Direct Effect (ADE)**: ≈ 3.3 points (95% CI [0.2, 6.4], *p* = .036)
- **Proportion Mediated**: ≈ 78%

**Interpretation**: Findings remain stable after controlling for prior_gpa, age, and gender. The mediation effect is **robust**.

3. **Indirect Effect**: 2.7 × 4.5 = 12.1 points (79% of total effect mediated)
4. **Direct Effect** (path c'): Small but significant (b = 3.2, *p* = .043, 21% of total)

### Discussion

#### Key Findings

1. **Total Effect**: The growth mindset intervention increased exam scores by **15.3 points** on average.

2. **Mediation Mechanism**: **Self-efficacy mediates 79%** of this effect:
   - Intervention increases self-efficacy (path a = 2.7)
   - Higher self-efficacy predicts higher exam scores (path b = 4.5)
   - Indirect effect = 12.1 points (CI [10.2, 14.0])

3. **Partial Mediation**: A small direct effect remains (3.2 points), suggesting other mechanisms may contribute (e.g., improved study habits, reduced anxiety, peer support).

4. **Robustness**: Results held after controlling for prior_gpa, age, and gender. Sensitivity analysis shows findings are robust unless there is a strong unmeasured confounder (ρ > 0.5).

#### Practical Implications

- **Target Self-Efficacy**: Future interventions should explicitly focus on building students' confidence (the key mechanism).
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Since 79% of the effect operates through self-efficacy, interventions could be streamlined to target this mediator more directly (e.g., mastery experiences, verbal persuasion).
- **Remaining Direct Effect**: The 21% direct effect suggests other pathways exist—future research could explore additional mediators (motivation, goal-setting, help-seeking behavior).

#### Limitations

1. **Temporal Ordering**: Self-efficacy and exam scores were measured post-intervention. Ideally, self-efficacy would be measured **mid-intervention** (before the exam) to establish clearer temporal precedence.

2. **Unmeasured Confounding**: Despite sensitivity analyses, we cannot rule out unmeasured variables (e.g., baseline motivation, cognitive ability) that might inflate the mediation effect.

3. **Single Mediator**: We tested only one mediator (self-efficacy). The intervention likely affects multiple mechanisms simultaneously (motivation, metacognition, social support). A **multiple mediator model** would provide a more complete picture.

4. **Generalizability**: Sample consisted of first-year psychology students at one university. Results may not generalize to other populations or academic subjects.

5. **Sample Size**: n = 100 is adequate for detecting the indirect effect (bootstrap power ≥ 0.80 for medium effects), but larger samples (n ≥ 150) would provide more stable estimates and allow testing of moderated mediation (e.g., does mediation differ by gender?).

#### Recommendations

1. **Replicate with Longitudinal Design**: Measure self-efficacy at Week 3 (mid-intervention) and exam scores at Week 8 to strengthen causal inference.

2. **Test Multiple Mediators**: Include motivation, study habits, and help-seeking as additional mediators.

3. **Explore Moderation**: Does mediation differ by baseline self-efficacy, prior_gpa, or demographic characteristics?

4. **Scale Up**: Conduct multi-site trial (n ≥ 300) to test generalizability and allow for subgroup analyses.

---

### Key Methodological Takeaways

1. **Mediation Requires n ≥ 80–100**: Bootstrap methods need adequate sample size for stable CIs. With n < 80, indirect effects may be underpowered.

2. **Use Bootstrap CIs, Not Sobel Test**: Bootstrap methods (5000+ iterations) provide more accurate Type I error rates than the outdated Sobel test.

3. **Control for Covariates**: Including baseline covariates (prior_gpa, demographics) reduces confounding and increases precision.

4. **Report All Effects**: Total, direct, indirect, and proportion mediated—full transparency allows readers to judge effect magnitudes.

5. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Always assess robustness to unmeasured confounding (especially in observational designs).

6. **Avoid Causal Language Unless Warranted**: Use "consistent with mediation" rather than "X causes Y via M" unless you have a true experiment with randomized manipulation of M and temporal separation.

7. **Mediation ≠ Mechanism**: Statistical mediation does not prove a psychological/biological mechanism—it shows statistical association patterns consistent with mediation.

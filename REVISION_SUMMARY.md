#### PLS-SEM Alternative Implementation (COMPLETED)
**Decision:** Rejected PLS-SEM inclusion, implemented 4 better alternatives:
1. ✅ Ridge/lasso/elastic net regression (for multiple predictors)
2. ✅ Simple mediation analysis (for indirect effects)
3. ✅ SEM sample size guidance (prevents misuse)
4. ✅ Bayesian regression (existing Chapter 5 content)

**Rationale:** PLS-SEM inappropriate for small samples due to:
- Inflated Type I error rates
- Unstable path coefficients
- Questionable convergent/discriminant validity
- Better alternatives available

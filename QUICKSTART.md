# Quick Start Guide
## Small Sample Quantitative Analysis Book

This guide will help you get started with the book in just a few steps.

---

## For RStudio Users (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites
- Download and install R from https://cran.r-project.org/
- Download and install RStudio from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
- Download and install Quarto from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

### Step 2: Open the Project
- Double-click `smallstat.Rproj` to open the project in RStudio
- RStudio will automatically set the working directory

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script
In the RStudio Console (bottom-left pane), type:
```r
source("setup.R")
```

This will:
- Install all required R packages
- Generate the synthetic datasets
- Verify everything is working

### Step 4: Explore the Book
- Open any chapter file from `chapters/` folder
- Click the green "Run" button to execute code chunks
- See results in the Console and Plots pane

### Step 5: Render the Book
In the Terminal tab (next to Console), type:
```bash
quarto render
```

Then open `_book/index.html` in your browser.

---

## For Command Line Users

### Prerequisites
Install R, RStudio (optional), and Quarto as above.

### Setup and Render

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd C:/Users/Mohammed.Ali/Documents/GitHub/smallstat

# Open R
R

# In R, run setup
source("setup.R")
quit()

# Render the book
quarto render
```

---

## Validation

To check that everything is working:

```r
# In R or RStudio Console
source("validation_script.R")
```

This runs test examples from each chapter. You should see:
```
=== VALIDATION COMPLETE ===

All key examples executed successfully!
```

## What's Included

### Datasets (Generated by setup.R)
- `data/mini_marketing.csv` - Marketing campaign comparison (n=30)
- `data/service_quality.csv` - Service quality scale (n=36)
- `data/process_change.csv` - Process improvement study (n=20)

### Helper Functions (`R/smalln_recipes.R`)
- `mw_test()` - Mann-Whitney U test with CI
- `wilcoxon_paired_ci()` - Wilcoxon signed-rank with CI
- `exact_2x2()` - Fisher's exact test
- `firth_logit_fit()` - Firth logistic regression
- `boot_median_ci()` - Bootstrap CI for median

### Chapters
- **Part A (2 chapters)**: Foundations
- **Part B (4 chapters)**: Data Collection and Preparation
- **Part C (6 chapters)**: Analysis Methods
- **Part D (4 chapters)**: Reporting and Interpretation
- **Part E (3 projects)**: Worked Examples

## Common Issues

### "Package not found"
**Solution**: Run `source("setup.R")` again to install missing packages.

### "Quarto command not found"
**Solution**: 
1. Install Quarto from https://quarto.org/
2. Restart your terminal/command prompt
3. Try `quarto render` again

### "Cannot open file 'data/mini_marketing.csv'"
**Solution**: Generate datasets with `source("R/make_datasets.R")`

### "brms package fails to install"
**Solution**: This package is optional. Skip it for now; most examples work without it. If needed, see https://mc-stan.org/ for RStan installation.

### Rendering is very slow
**Solution**: This is normal for the first render (15-30 minutes). Subsequent renders are much faster due to caching.

## Getting Help

1. **Check README.md** for full documentation
2. **Run validation_script.R** to test your setup
3. **Review error messages** carefully - they often indicate which package is missing
4. **Check Quarto documentation** at https://quarto.org/docs/guide/

---

## Next Steps

Once setup is complete:

1. **Read the Preface** (`index.qmd`) for an overview
2. **Start with Part A** (Foundations) to understand the rationale
3. **Work through Part C** (Analysis Methods) for the core techniques
4. **Study Part E** (Worked Projects) for complete examples
5. **Practice** by modifying the code examples with your own data

**Ready to start?**

```r
# In RStudio
source("setup.R")          # One-time setup
source("R/smalln_recipes.R")  # Load helper functions

# Start exploring!
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("data/mini_marketing.csv")
glimpse(data)
```

# Education Domain Expansion Summary
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Scope:** Phase 1 expansion to include education as a primary target domain

---

## Overview

The book "Quantitative Analysis with Small Samples" has been successfully expanded from its original focus (social sciences, health sciences, business) to include **education** as a fourth primary domain. This expansion required **minimal methodological changes** since the statistical methods (t-tests, effect sizes, nonparametric tests) are identical across domains—only the **context, datasets, and examples** were modified.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Updated Target Audience** ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `chapters/part-h-instructors-manual.qmd` (Section 1.1)
- `index.qmd` (Preface)
- `README.md` (Introduction)

**Changes:**
- Added "education" explicitly to primary audience lists
- Specified education sub-disciplines: curriculum & instruction, educational psychology, special education, teacher education
- Added education practitioner roles: classroom teachers, instructional coaches, school administrators
- Updated book description to mention "pilot educational programs" and "classroom-based research"

**Before:** "social sciences, health sciences, business"  
**After:** "social sciences, health sciences, business, **education**"

---

### 2. **Created Education-Specific Datasets** ✅

**File Modified:** `R/make_datasets.R`

**New Datasets (3 total):**

| Dataset | n | Type | Use Case | Variables |
|---------|---|------|----------|-----------|
| **classroom_reading.csv** | 22 | Paired pre/post | Literacy intervention evaluation | student_id, grade_level, pre_reading_score, post_reading_score, improvement, teacher |
| **peer_tutoring.csv** | 30 | Two-group comparison | Instructional methods comparison | student_id, method (Peer-Led/Teacher-Led), test_score, prior_gpa, attendance_rate |
| **quiz_reliability.csv** | 28 | Binary items | Quiz reliability analysis (KR-20) | student_id, item1-item5 (0/1 correct/incorrect) |

**Statistical Applications:**
- **classroom_reading.csv**: Paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Cohen's d for paired design
- **peer_tutoring.csv**: Independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U, effect sizes for group comparison
- **quiz_reliability.csv**: KR-20 reliability (for binary items), item analysis, difficulty indices

**All datasets generated successfully:** Confirmed by running `Rscript R/make_datasets.R`

---

### 3. **Added Complete Education Worked Example** ✅

**File Modified:** `chapters/part-e-worked-projects.qmd`

**New Content:** Project 4 - "Evaluating a Reading Intervention in Small Classrooms" (~350 lines)

**Project Structure:**
- **Background:** 10-week reading intervention for struggling readers (grades 3-4)
- **Research Questions:** (1) Did scores improve? (2) Effect size? (3) Robustness? (4) Subgroup differences?
- **Methods Demonstrated:**
  - Paired t-test with normality checks (Shapiro-Wilk, Q-Q plots)
  - Cohen's *d* for paired design with 95% CI
  - Wilcoxon signed-rank test (sensitivity analysis)
  - Exploratory subgroup analyses (by teacher, by grade)
- **Visualizations:**
  - Histogram of improvement scores
  - Spaghetti plot (individual trajectories)
  - Boxplots by teacher and grade level
- **Key Findings:** Mean improvement = 8 points, *t*(21) = 7.5, *p* < .001, *d* = 1.60 (large effect)
- **Educational Significance:** 8-point improvement moves average student from 50th to 95th percentile
- **Limitations Discussed:** No control group, small sample, regression to mean, short-term follow-up
- **Recommendations:** Conduct RCT, assess retention, expand sample, investigate heterogeneity, cost-effectiveness

**Pedagogical Value:**
- Demonstrates pre-post design common in educational research
- Shows how to interpret effect sizes in educational context
- Addresses threats to validity (maturation, practice effects)
- Models transparent reporting of limitations
- Connects statistical significance to educational significance

**File Growth:** part-e-worked-projects.qmd increased from 715 → 1064 lines (+349 lines, +49%)

---

### 4. **Updated Datasets Documentation** ✅

**File Modified:** `chapters/part-f-technical-appendices.qmd` (Section: Part 5 Supplementary Datasets)

**Changes:**
- Reorganized dataset listings by domain (Education, Health, Business, Operations)
- Added complete code snippets for generating all 3 education datasets
- Included "Education Applications" section explaining use cases
- Updated dataset count from 8 → 12 (now includes 3 education + existing 9)
- Added cross-references to worked Project 4

**File Growth:** part-f-technical-appendices.qmd increased from 1190 → 1270 lines (+80 lines, +7%)

---

### 5. **Added Education Examples in Core Chapters** ✅

**File Modified:** `chapters/part-a-foundations.qmd` (Chapter 1)

**Changes:**
- Updated "Why Small Samples Are Often Unavoidable" section
- Added education-specific bullet point: "classroom-based educational interventions"
- Created "Examples of small-sample contexts" subsection with 4 domains:
  - **Education:** New teaching methods in single classrooms (n=15-25), specialized programs (gifted/special ed), teacher professional development
  - Health sciences (existing)
  - Business (existing)
  - Social sciences (existing)

**Impact:** Education now appears alongside health/business/social sciences as legitimate small-sample research context from Chapter 1 forward.

## Methodological Note

**Key Insight:** No new statistical methods were required for education expansion.

| Educational Research Need | Existing Chapter Coverage | Method Used |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Compare teaching methods | Ch 3-4 (t-tests, Mann-Whitney) | ✅ Already covered |
| Pre/post intervention | Ch 4 (paired tests, Wilcoxon) | ✅ Already covered |
| Effect sizes | Ch 13 (Cohen's d, CIs) | ✅ Already covered |
| Quiz/test reliability | Ch 6 (Cronbach's α, KR-20) | ✅ Already covered |
| Small class sizes | Ch 1-2 (foundations, power) | ✅ Already covered |
| Non-normal scores | Ch 4 (nonparametric) | ✅ Already covered |

**Conclusion:** Educational applications fit seamlessly into the existing methodological framework. The expansion required only:
1. Domain-specific datasets
2. Educational context examples
3. Interpretation guidance for education metrics (e.g., reading scores, test performance)

## Usage Examples

### For Education Researchers

**Example 1: Classroom Intervention Evaluation**
```r
library(tidyverse)
library(effsize)

# Load literacy intervention data
reading_data <- read_csv("data/classroom_reading.csv")

# Paired t-test
t.test(reading_data$post_reading_score, 
       reading_data$pre_reading_score, 
       paired = TRUE)

# Effect size
cohen.d(reading_data$post_reading_score, 
        reading_data$pre_reading_score, 
        paired = TRUE)
```

**Example 2: Comparing Instructional Methods**
```r
# Load peer tutoring data
tutoring_data <- read_csv("data/peer_tutoring.csv")

# Mann-Whitney U test (if scores are skewed)
wilcox.test(test_score ~ method, data = tutoring_data)

# Independent t-test (if approximately normal)
t.test(test_score ~ method, data = tutoring_data)
```

**Example 3: Quiz Reliability Analysis**
```r
library(psych)

# Load quiz data
quiz_data <- read_csv("data/quiz_reliability.csv")

# KR-20 reliability for binary items
KR20(quiz_data[, -1])  # Exclude student_id column

# Item analysis
describe(quiz_data[, -1])
```

## Next Steps (Optional Phase 2: Shipping & Logistics)

If expanding to **shipping and logistics** (moderate effort, 25-35 hours):

### High-Feasibility Applications
- Route/carrier comparisons (use Ch 3-4 comparison tests) ✅
- Warehouse process improvements (use Ch 4 paired designs) ✅
- Fleet efficiency studies (use Ch 13 effect sizes) ✅
- Service quality metrics (adapt Project 2 service quality scale) ✅
- Equipment failure prediction (use Ch 5 Firth regression for rare events) ✅

### Would Require New Content
- Time-series route optimization (Ch 8 is only basic, would need expansion) ⚠️
- Network flow analysis (not currently covered) ❌
- Spatial logistics (not currently covered) ❌

### Recommended Focus
- Limit to **operational applications** that fit existing methods
- Emphasize small fleet comparisons, pilot route testing, process efficiency
- Avoid complex optimization/network problems outside book scope
